# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

I created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

When you open the planner then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
When you scroll down then you are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
When you view the timeblocks for that day then each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
When you click into a timeblock then you can enter an event
When you click the save button for that timeblock then the text for that event is saved in local storage
When you refresh the page then the saved events persist
